# What is my corporate email?

## Motivation

Let's imagine that a company is offering a new service to other companies.

The new offering to businesses aims to make us a lucrative option for companies to promote learning & developement for their employees. We often reach out to different representatives from businesses to promote the value proposition we offer.

We maintain a database of the contacts we already have in various companies. However, we do not always have the email addresses of the people we should pitch to in these companies. We do have their full names and company domain.

## Developement

This is a full-stack application that maintains a logic to predict the corporate email based on patterns already knew.

So, the frontend takes care of the input data, showing to the user each company domains our backend already know and can send a certain prediction.

Feel free to play on both repos:

[Frontend](frontend/README.md)

[Backend](backend/README.md)

## Backlog

As a project that just started (focused ~8h developing it), here is a backlog list with the next steps and activities that can be done.

Feel free to also add taks if you had an idea or a feedback!
